# caraCracha
CaraCracha is a captive portal project made for ISPs on my old city, Sobradinho, state of Bahia, Brazil.

CaraCracha first version was developed by me about 2000's (I think) for a friend's ISP named *Turbo Net*, then It was used by 6 other ISPs from Sobradinho, Casa Nova, Juazeiro on Bahia State and Petrolina, Pernambuco State.

I've lost its code, but my very best friend (@afernandescneto) found its code recently and hope it could be useful for someone.

Thank you Net√£o! 
You love bro!
